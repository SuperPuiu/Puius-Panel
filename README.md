# Puius Panel
Puius Panel is a lightweight panel which can be easily extended to support more than the "vanilla" commands provided
by making use of the "Plugins" feature it supports. Puius Panel also comes with an additional anti cheat abbreviated "PAC".

# Puius Anti Cheat
Puius Anti Cheat offers additional protection to the game, and it is encouraged to be used *along* the panel itself.

# Panel Deployment
It is recommended that you build the panel yourself (`rojo build /path/to/panel -o Panel.rbxm`) and import it to the game.
Additionally, stable releases appear occasionally, which you can make use of.

# License
Puius Panel is available under the terms of the MIT license.
