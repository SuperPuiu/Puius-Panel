# Puius Panel
Puius Panel is a lightweight panel which can be easily extended to support more than the "vanilla" commands provided,
by making use of the "Plugins" feature it supports. The panel also comes with a terminal which can be separated from the 'graphical'
component.

# Panel Deployment
It is recommended that you build the panel yourself (`rojo build /path/to/panel -o Panel.rbxm`) and import it to the game.
Additionally, stable releases appear occasionally, which you can make use of.

# License
Puius Panel is available under the terms of the MIT license.
